# Workflow Test Project

This project contains a GitHub workflow to test automatic PR labeling based on approvals.

## How to Test:

1.  **Create a new GitHub repository** and push this project to it.
2.  **Create a pull request** in your GitHub repository.
3.  **Have at least two users review and approve** the pull request. These can be a mix of internal collaborators and external contributors (if your repository settings allow external contributions and reviews).
4.  **Observe the PR labels**: After two approvals, the PR should automatically be labeled with `approved`.
